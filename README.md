# ReplierBot
This script checks if a specific user sends a Tweet, and when it is sent it automatically sends a reply with a predefined message.

It's my first project I upload to GitHub. So please if you have any idea to improve I will be very happy to modify!
Also the idea for this project comes from a joke with a friend that he regarded that he couldn't say an user how stupid he was every time that user published a tweet..
